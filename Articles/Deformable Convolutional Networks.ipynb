    "Convolutional Neural Networks are inherently limited to model large, unknown transformations. The limitation originates from the fixed geometric structures of modules: a convolution unit samples the input feature map at fixed locations; a pooling layer reduces the spatial resolution at a fixed ratio; an RoI (region-of-interest) pooling layer sepa rates an RoI into fixed spatial bins, etc. There lacks internal mechanisms to handle the geometric transformations."

In the training, these added layers for offset learning are initialized with zero weights. Their learning rates are set to $\\beta$ times ($\\beta$ = 1 by default, and $\\beta$ = 0.01 for the fully connected layers in Faster R-CNN) of the learning rate for the existing layers. They are trained via back propagation through the bilinear interpolation operations. The resulting CNNs are called deformable ConvNets."
