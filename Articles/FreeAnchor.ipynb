    "On the one hand, for objects of acentric features, the most representative features are not close to object centers. A spatially aligned anchor might correspond to fewer representative features, which deteriorate classification and localization capabilities. On the other hand, it is infeasible to match proper anchors/features for objects using IoU when multiple objects come together."

    "2. In order to achieve high detection precision, the detector needs to classify anchors with poor localization (large bounding box regression error) into background.\n",
    "3. The predictions of anchors should be compatible with the non-maximum suppression (NMS) procedure, i.e., the higher the classification score is, the more accurate the localization is. Otherwise, an anchor with accurate localization but low classification score could be suppressed when using the NMS process."
